##Shiny App Project

___

For this project I developed a Shiny App that used Galton's classic data set to estimate the height of a child using the height of both parents. 

The Shiny App is located here: https://eleakin.shinyapps.io/DDP3/

The GitHub repo is here: https://github.com/eleakin/shinyapp
